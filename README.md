NOTE: Help came from certain StackOverflow exchanges, please see the attached link in the appropriate files.
TLDR: Does alot with colour. To understand more, download the files and play with it yourself. 

**HELP**: Last time I checked, the button which uploaded images does not work. If this is still the case, drop me a comment. Apart from the button, everything else should work. TIA!

"The Project22stv110.java class is where an object of the Display class is created, and added the the JFrame.
The Display class is where ColorCodes, ColorEncyclopedia, and TellTheColor objects are created and added to a JTabbedPane.

ColorCodes :: The ColorCodes class consists of a gradient (three colour) and three ColorSliderPanels.  The ColorSliderPanels control the red, green and blue values of the gradient. The three colours of the gradient are black, white and the colour derived from the slider panels. When the gradient is clicked, the pixel clicked’s colour is shown, as well as its HTML colour code.

The ColorCodes class uses the following classes:: ColorSliderPanel, and ThreeWayGradient

ColorSliderPanel is a subclass of JPanel with a JSlider. 
ThreeWayGradient creates a three colour gradient with the three provided colours.

TellTheColor :: The TellTheColor class can derive the colour of an image. When the mouse hovers over the picture, a JTextField displays the colour the mouse is on; upon clicking the picture, the colour’s information as well as shades and tints are shown. The logger may choose its own file from the computer by clicking the browse button. 

The TellTheColor class uses the following class :: JPEGImageFileFilter.

ColorEncyclopedia :: The ColorEncyclopedia class, with an imputed colour, will display tints, shades, and complementary colours, as well as the colour’s HTML, RGB and CMYK colour codes.
The logger can enter a colour by using HTML codes, RGB codes, or CMYK codes. (Note:: Please enter RGB values from 0..255 and CMYK values from 0..1).

The ColorEncyclopedia class does not use any other classes."
